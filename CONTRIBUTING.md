Reporting bugs
==============

- State your platform and mpv version.
- Attach a log file made with ``-v`` or ``--log-file=output.txt``.
- If you think this is file specific, upload a sample file and link it.
- Don't report multiple unrelated/barely related bugs in one issue.
- Read: https://mpv.io/bug-reports/

Asking questions
================

Preferably, asking questions should be done via IRC (#mpv on irc.freenode.net),
but asking questions by opening is also barely tolerated.

Sending patches
===============

See: https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/DOCS/contribute.md

In particular, be aware that all changes to GPL code must come with the
implicit agreement that they might be LGPLv2.1+ relicensed at a later point.
